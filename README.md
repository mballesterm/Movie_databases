# Movie_databases

In this repository we work explicitly with SQL and the Google Database. Here we answer different questions presented in the Notebooks with the help of SQL. Here you can see a Dataset of the movies that have been published.

Here you can see which movie has had the best ranking, which has been the most watched, the most popular, etc. You can also search for some other movies that I have found entertaining, such as the Lord of the Rings.
